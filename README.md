# Budget Tracker

A budget tracking application built with Next.js and TypeScript. This app allows users to manage their finances effectively, track expenses, and visualize their spending patterns.

## Project Description

Budget Tracker is a user-friendly application designed to help you manage your finances effectively. It features three main pages:

### 1. Dashboard

The dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of your financial situation, including:

- **Total Current Balance**
- **Monthly Balance**
- **Monthly Income**
- **Monthly Expenses**

From here, you can easily add new income or expenses through intuitive buttons. Clicking a button opens a modal where you can enter details such as description, amount, date, and category.

Additionally, the dashboard showcases:

- **Recent Transactions**: A list displaying the date, description, and amount of your latest transactions.
- **Visual Analytics**: Three dynamic graphs to help you understand your finances:
  - **Pie Chart**: Breakdown of income and expenses by category.
  - **Bar Chart**: Monthly history of income and expenses.
  - **Radial Chart**: Ratio of income to expenses.

You can navigate between months effortlessly using arrow buttons.

The transactions page provides a detailed view of all your monthly transactions, including:

- Date
- Description

### 3. Settings

In the settings page, you can view and edit your total current balance, giving you full control over your finances.

### Account Creation

During the account creation process, youâ€™ll have access to a dedicated page where you can set your initial balance. This page is only accessible while creating your account (but you can still edit it later in Settings page).

### Data Encryption
All data related to transactions is securely encrypted, ensuring that your financial information remains confidential and protected.

### Responsive Design

The application is fully mobile-responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on devices of all sizes. Users can enjoy a consistent interface whether on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

### Light and Dark Mode

The app automatically adjusts between light and dark modes based on the user's system settings, providing a comfortable viewing experience at all times.
